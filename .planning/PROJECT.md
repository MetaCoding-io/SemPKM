# SemPKM

## What This Is

SemPKM is a semantics-native personal knowledge management platform where users store RDF data and interact with it through typed objects, relationships, and views — powered by installable "Mental Models" that bundle ontologies, SHACL shapes, views, and seed data into instant PKM experiences. It's a self-hosted web application with a Python/FastAPI backend and an htmx/vanilla-web frontend: admin portal for model and webhook management, IDE-style workspace for object creation and editing, and multi-renderer data browsing (table, cards, graph).

## Core Value

Install a Mental Model and immediately create, browse, and explore structured knowledge through auto-generated forms, views, and graph visualizations — no blank-page syndrome, no schema setup.

### Active

<!-- Next milestone candidates. -->

- [ ] Dashboards: parameterized panels, type-based registry (objectSelf, view, lintSummary, markdown)
- [ ] Sidebar logout button with VS Code-style user menu
- [ ] Improved 403 error display in workspace content area
- [ ] Full-text search across objects
- [ ] JSON-LD export for objects/collections
- [ ] Edge model enhancements: edge inspector panel, inline wiki-link-speed creation
- [ ] Backlinks panel (incoming references for any object)
- [ ] Cookie secure=True for production deployment
- [ ] SMTP integration for magic link delivery (currently logged to console)

### Out of Scope

- Read/write filesystem projections — v2 (read-only projection also deferred)
- Mental Model migrations and user overrides — v2+
- Offline/multi-device sync — v2+
- Embedded n8n workflow engine — v2+
- Advanced webhook delivery/security (DLQ, signing, strict ordering) — v3
- Bidirectional ActivityPub — v2+
- SOLID export/publish — deferred
- Timeline/calendar renderers — v1.1/v2
- 3D graph visualization — experimental, deferred
- SPARQL UPDATE as external write surface — by design (bypasses event sourcing)
- Real-time collaborative editing — CRDT/OT complexity, v2+ at earliest
- AI/LLM integration — SemPKM's moat is semantic structure, not AI, v2+
- Mobile native app — web-first, responsive design and eventual PWA
- Ontology editor — consume via Mental Models; use Protege for authoring

## Context

**Current state (v1.0 shipped 2026-02-23):**
- ~19,900 LOC across Python (9,230), JavaScript (2,584), HTML/Jinja2 (1,918), CSS (3,360), JSON-LD (2,643)
- Tech stack: FastAPI + RDF4J + htmx/vanilla-web + SQLAlchemy (SQLite)
- 227 files, 158 commits across 9 phases and 26 plans
- Docker Compose deployment: 3 services (api, triplestore, frontend/nginx)

**Design references:**
- v0.3 design documents in `orig_specs/` (vision, specifications, decision log, schemas)
- `semantic-stack` reference project for triplestore Docker deployment

**Known tech debt:**
- Dual SQLAlchemy engine instances (module-level + lifespan) — harmless for SQLite, needs fix for PostgreSQL
- `empty_shapes_loader` dead code in validation service
- SUMMARY frontmatter uses `provides` instead of `requirements-completed`
- Phase 6 requirements not in REQUIREMENTS.md traceability table (tracked in ROADMAP.md)

## Constraints

- **Backend**: Python + FastAPI (async, Pydantic models, OpenAPI docs)
- **Frontend**: htmx + vanilla JavaScript throughout (admin, workspace, views)
- **Triplestore**: RDF4J 5.x, deployed via Docker (internal only, no host port exposure)
- **Auth database**: SQLAlchemy async ORM (SQLite local, PostgreSQL for cloud)
- **Events**: Stored as RDF in named graphs within the triplestore (triplestore-native event sourcing)
- **Deployment**: Self-hosted Docker Compose (3 services)
- **Auth**: Passwordless (setup token local, magic links cloud), session-based cookies
- **Standards**: RDF, SPARQL 1.1, SHACL Core (pragmatic subset), JSON-LD for models

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Event sourcing as canonical truth | Supports automation, auditability, future sync strategies | ✓ Good — immutable events enable provenance tracking, audit trail |
| Edges as first-class resources (sempkm:Edge) | UX needs stable edge identity for inspection, annotation, provenance | ✓ Good — clean edge CRUD, minted IRIs |
| SHACL subset drives UI (forms + linting) | SHACL already encodes field structure, constraints, severity, layout hints | ✓ Good — auto-generated forms from shapes, lint panel with violations/warnings |
| Triplestore-native event storage | Events as RDF named graphs, keeping everything in one data layer | ✓ Good — atomic transactions, no separate event store |
| htmx throughout (no React) | Simpler architecture, htmx + vanilla JS sufficient for all UI needs | ✓ Good — eliminated iframe complexity, consistent stack |
| RDF4J over Blazegraph | Blazegraph unmaintained since 2020; RDF4J actively maintained | ✓ Good — stable, well-documented API |
| FastAPI backend | Modern Python async framework, OpenAPI docs, Pydantic models | ✓ Good — clean async patterns, dependency injection |
| Passwordless auth with magic links | Zero-friction UX, no password management complexity | ✓ Good — setup wizard + auto-login for local dev |
| SQLite for local auth, PostgreSQL for cloud | Dual-database strategy for zero-config local and scalable cloud | ✓ Good — Alembic migrations work for both |
| Violations gate conformance ops only | SHACL is assistive (linting), not punitive — users can always edit | ✓ Good — export/publish blocked, saves always allowed |
| Filesystem projection deferred | Focus v1 on the core create/browse/explore loop first | ✓ Good — avoided scope creep, v1 loop is complete |
| Private-by-default cross-model embedding | Explicit exports prevent accidental coupling between Mental Models | — Pending (not yet exercised with multiple models) |
